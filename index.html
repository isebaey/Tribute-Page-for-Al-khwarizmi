            <h3 class="headline">Here's a time line of Al-Khwarizmi's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Persia of that time around 780.
                </li>
                <li><b>1914</b> - He was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer
                    geographer and a scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.
                </li>
                <li><b>1914</b> - He flourished while working as a member of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad under
                    the leadership of Kalif al-Mamun, the son of the Khalif Harun al-Rashid, who was made famous in the
                    Arabian Nights.
                </li>
                <li><b>1914</b> - He developed the concept of the algorithm in mathematics (which is a reason for
                    his being called the grandfather of computer science by some people).
                </li>
                </li>
                <li><b>1914</b> - Al-Khwarizmi’s algebra is regarded as the foundation and cornerstone of the sciences.
                    To
                    al-Khwarizmi we owe the world “algebra,” from the title of his greatest mathematical work, Hisab
                    al-Jabr
                    wa-al-Muqabala book.
                </li>
                <li><b>1914</b> - He confined his discussion to equations of the first and second degrees. He also
                    wrote an important work on astronomy, covering calendars, calculating true positions of the sun,
                    moon
                    and planets, tables of sines and tangents, spherical astronomy, astrological tables, parallax and
                    eclipse calculations, and visibility of the moon. His astronomical work, Zij al-sindhind, is also
                    based
                    on the work of other scientists. As with the Algebra, its chief interest is as the earliest Arab
                    work
                    still in existence in Arabic.
                </li>
                <li><b>1914</b> - Died c. 850.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <q id="quote"><i>That fondness for science, ... that affability and condescension which God shows to the
                    learned,
                    that
                    promptitude with which he protects and supports them in the elucidation of obscurities and in the
                    removal of
                    difficulties, has encouraged me to compose a short work on calculating by al-jabr and al-muqabala ,
                    confining it to what is easiest and most useful in arithmetic.</i>
